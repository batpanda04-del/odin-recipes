        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This no-bake orange creamsicle pie tastes just like the childhood favorite frozen treat, creamy, rich, and with a bright, punchy orange pop from fresh orange zest and juice, along with orange Jell-O.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>&frac12; (3 ounces) package orange flavored gelatin</li>
            <li>&frac13; cup boiling water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grated orange zest, plus more for garnish</li>
            <li>&frac12; cup fresh orange juice</li>
            <li>4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed</li>
            <li>1 (9 inch) ready-to-use graham cracker pie crust</li>
            <li>&frac12; cup drained, canned mandarin oranges in water, patted dry</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Whisk orange gelatin and boiling water together in a medium bowl until completely dissolved and slightly cooled, about 2 minutes. Whisk in orange zest and juice until combined. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Whisk cream cheese in a large bowl until smooth, about 30 seconds. Gradually whisk in gelatin mixture until smooth.</li>
            <li>Whisk in 1 1/2 cups whipped topping until smooth and no lumps remain; refrigerate creamsicle filling uncovered, until partially set and slightly thickened, about 30 minutes</li>
            <li>Pour filling into graham cracker crust and spread evenly. Cover and refrigerate until set, at least 4 hours or up to overnight.</li>
            <li>Before serving, spoon the remaining 1 1/2 cups whipped topping over the orange layer and spread into an even layer.</li>
            <li>Arrange mandarins decoratively over the top, sprinkle with zest, and serve.</li>
        </ol>
